# Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Municipal Corporation (CSMC) — Redesigned Citizen Services Portal

A next-generation, mobile-first, and accessible e-governance platform for Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Municipal Corporation (formerly Aurangabad Municipal Corporation). This portal is optimized for Marathi-speaking, low-to-semi-technical, and low-bandwidth citizens, removing login barriers for public information and essential interactions.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔓 Guest & Public Portal (Unauthenticated)
To improve usability and eliminate friction, the portal features a dedicated unauthenticated route group `(public)` supporting:
- **Hero & Landing Section** - Important municipal announcements, official contacts, and quick links.
- **Services Hub** - A comprehensive dashboard of all available services categorized by department.
- **Guest Complaint Filing & Tracking** - Register complaints with location coordinates and attachments, and track real-time resolution status without needing an account.
- **Tenders Portal** - View and filter active municipal tenders with date-sorting.
- **Document & RTS Directory** - Download key forms, Right to Services (RTS) documents, and Right to Information (RTI) sheets.

### 🔐 Authenticated Dashboards (Citizen, Officer & Admin)
For personalized and secure municipal tasks:
- **Citizen Account** - Manage properties, view and pay property tax receipts, track historical water bills, and request digital certificates.
- **Officer Console** - Review applications, update complaint statuses, and assign tasks.
- **Admin Dashboard** - Role-based access control (RBAC), audit logging, and service configurations.

### 🌐 Custom i18n & Accessibility
- **Marathi-First Design** - Marathi is initialized as the primary default language, with a persistent client-side locale switcher to English.
- **AAA Typography Controls** - Native font-size adjustments (A- / A / A+) on all headers and pages to improve legibility.
- **High Contrast & Accessible Layout** - Full WCAG 2.2 AA compliance, large touch targets (min 44x44px), and keyboard-navigable components.

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Firebase CLI installed globally (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
- A Firebase Project (for local development or deployment)

### Local Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BhaveshKhaple/csnmahanagarpalika.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Firebase configurations:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
   ```

4. **Start Firebase Emulators (Optional but recommended)**
   If you have the Firebase Emulator Suite configured for local firestore/auth testing:
   ```bash
   npm run firebase:emulators
   ```

5. **Start the Next.js Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🧪 Testing

The codebase includes test suites built using Jest and React Testing Library:

```bash
# Run all unit and integration tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate test coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## 🔒 Security & Performance

- **Sandboxed Guest Writes**: Public actions (like guest complaints) are written directly to a sandboxed Firestore space with validation schemas and strict write-only rules.
- **API Rate Limiting**: Next.js API endpoints use serverless rate limits to prevent brute-force abuse and API spamming.
- **Adaptive Components**: Component layouts leverage `@tailwindcss/container-queries` to shift gracefully on container size adjustments, preventing visual overlap or excessive layout shifts.
- **Optimized Media Assets**: Serves responsive images and defers loading of heavy video components to save mobile bandwidth.
